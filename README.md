# Advent of Code

## A month of coding challenges

I'm completing the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)! 

These are my notes for the problems I've done so far. 

- December 1, 2022:
  - Plenty of optimizations to be made here. This question was an opportunity to work with reduce, which can be tricky. 
  - Optimization: Can we chain methods to make this a single operation on a single pass? 
- December 2, 2022:
  - The input files seem to merit a module to unpack them properly. 
  - This is an instance which might merit switch. Nested else statements welcome errors.
- December 3, 2022:
  - I made my way to the solutions eventually. I'm working on naming things more accurately and, ideally, keeping it to 1 thing 1 task.
  - My code is long, but a refactor will reduce it significantly due to repeated code.
